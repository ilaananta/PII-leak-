# PII-leak
Apps running on mobile devices extensively track and leak users' personal data. Personally identifiable information (PII) is a generic term referring to “information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity”. These can include geographic locations, unique identifiers, phone numbers and other similar data.<br />
The code in this repository is used to analyse the results obtained from the  ReCon model  .<br />
The code in the neural folder is used to  make a new model.<br /> 
The proposed model is trained using the already collected labeled data. It employs a deep learning technique to train the model and make predictions for the newly detected data.<br />

The dataset consists of data from two papers ReCon and Antshield. <br />
The .arff files are made using ReCon code
